## Hello from Phsyclone212
   This has been a very fun project! It is a CLI game where you search for the exit in a large grid maze,
   whilst trying not to die.


## CONTINUATION OF DEVELOPMENT
   I'm still adding things to this project, the little note about the project path i followed to get started is at the bottom should this get too long.
   **Finish the `Chests` class**
   - Needs overhaul to generate chest loot more randomly, as well as type of chest randomly.
   **Implement skill bonuses in `Player` class**
   - Why does leveling matter? What benefits do we get?
   - Should health scale with level?


   DISCLAIMER: NONE of the code in this project was generated by ChatGPT. Why does that need a disclaimer? It doesn't.
   But I want people to know that AI can help you learn and still do the good hard work yourself!
   
   Below is the Project Path I had designed by our good friend ChatGPT, which was immensely helpful,
   so I'm leaving the entirety of it for anyone to copy or just read over.
